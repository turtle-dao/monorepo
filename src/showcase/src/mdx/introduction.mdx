## What is Turtle.Club?

Turtle.Club is the first **Distribution Protocol** that monetizes the Web3 activity of our users by tracking their wallet activity for:

* liquidity they deploy and the yield they earn
  
* swaps they make and route through protocol partners
  
* the stake they delegate to our validators
  
* referral code they use
  

Turtle monetizes any activity that makes economic sense by leveraging trustless APIs, allowing distribution partners to generate additional income without exposing users to any additional risks, actions or steps. Turtle members benefit through -

* **Exclusive Deals:** Access to backroom liquidity deals to boost yields that a user would not normally have access to.
  
* **Sustainable Growth:** Contribute to and benefit from the sustainable growth of partner protocols.
  
* **DAO Framework:** Operate within a decentralized autonomous organization that realigns incentives among key Web3 stakeholders, including developers, LPs, venture capitalists, and auditors.
  
* **No Fees:** Enjoy zero management and performance fees.
  
* **No Smart Contracts:** Avoid the complexities and risks associated with smart contracts. All our tracking is done via API.
  
* **Self-Custody:** Your funds remain entirely under your control.
  
* **Inclusive Access:** Open to everyone, not just institutions or accredited investors.
  
* **Influence and Returns:** Gain vested interest and influence in partner protocols, boosting your yields.

Turtle aims to align the incentives amongst key DeFi players, Liquidity Providers (LPs), Developers, Venture Capitalists, Security Auditors, and Miners.

The core mission of Turtle.Club is to offer a safeguarding layer in DeFi, ensuring that liquidity is deployed with transparency and due diligence, promoting superior risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders while mitigating protocol and downside risks.

Since our MVP launch in March 2024, Turtle has grown into Web3's largest distribution protocol, with over 275,000+ wallets registered to boost their Web3 rewards. Membership is as simple as signing a single message!

## How does Turtle.Club Work?

### Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers (LP) only need to register their wallet with Turtle.Club by signing a message to accept the terms and conditions. After which, LPs continue their normal activities with protocols. If protocols are partners with Turtle.Club, LPs generates 5% to 50% of additional token emissions which are sent to the TurtleDAO Treasury. LP's will be issued with Turtle Tokens based off the amount of emissions they helped the TurtleDAO receive.

### Protocols & Partners

Monetize and Earn Revenue: Leverage your distribution to generate consistent revenue streams while farming ownership and upside in Turtle’s distribution protocol. Maximize Rewards and Utility for Your Users and ,through Turtle Club, unlock significant rewards across all layers of the Web3 stack, boosting yields by up to 7x to 8x on the same underlying liquidity. By leveraging collective bargaining power that rivals the largest liquid funds globally, Turtle empowers your protocol or product with unparalleled utility and tangible benefits. Seamless integration with Turtle allows you to enrich user experiences, incentivize off-chain activities without introducing risks or friction, and deliver real rewards that enhance loyalty and engagement.

## How is Turtle Club Safe?

* Never acts as a counterparty in any LP transaction within Web3. You deposit in the protocols themselves
  
* Never controls or handles members’ liquidity, ensuring utmost security and autonomy.
  

The absence of smart contracts offers several advantages for Turtle:

* Maintaining agility and adaptability, seamlessly integrating with various protocols without added complexity.
  
* Minimizing technical debt and counterparty risk by eliminating an additional smart contract layer.
  
* Reducing gas fees for depositing and withdrawing funds from partner protocols.
  
* Mitigating regulatory risks associated because turtle does not hold your funds.
